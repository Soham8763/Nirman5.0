# Contributing to Cogni-Safe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cogni-Safe! To ensure a smooth collaboration process, we follow a **Fork and Pull** workflow. This means you should not push directly to this repository. Instead, you will fork the repository, make changes in your own copy, and submit a Pull Request (PR).

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of this page to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cogni-safe.git
cd cogni-safe
```

### 3. Create a Branch
Always create a new branch for your changes. Do not work directly on `main`.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### 4. Make Changes and Commit
Make your changes, then stage and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a clear and concise description of your change"
```

### 5. Push to Your Fork
Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request
1. Go to the original repository on GitHub.
2. You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch.
3. If not, go to the **Pull requests** tab and click **New pull request**.
4. Click **compare across forks**.
5. Select your fork and branch as the "head repository".
6. Fill out the PR template and submit!

## Important Note
Please **do not** push directly to the main repository. All changes must come through a Pull Request from a fork.
